# Global Earthquake analysis
This repository documents analysis of earthquake data by USGS. We are investigating the seismic energy per country and the spatial of earthquakes.
## Usage
Our dataset is retrieved from the Earthquake catalog by USGS. It is saved as a CSV file named `USGS_Global_Earthquakes_2021_GT_4Mag.csv` that contains all the eartquakes occured in 2021 with a magnitude greater than 4.0. All the methods we used to analyze the dataset are summarized in the `Earthquake_analysis.ipynb` jupyter notebook. The notebook enables investigation of per country seismic energy, mean distance between earthquakes, the cities affected by the earthquakes, the relation between the magnitude of the events and their depth, and visualization of the results.
